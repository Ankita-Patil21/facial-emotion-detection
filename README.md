# facial-emotion-detection
This project develops a system that uses computer vision and machine learning to analyze facial features from images or video and automatically classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, or neutrality in real time.
# 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Detection using Computer Vision & Machine Learning

This project develops a system that leverages **computer vision** and **machine learning** to analyze facial features from images or video streams and automatically classify human emotions in real time. The system detects and classifies emotions such as **happiness**, **sadness**, **anger**, **surprise**, **fear**, and **neutrality** with the goal of enabling intuitive and intelligent human-computer interaction.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🎥 Real-time facial detection via webcam or video input
- 🤖 Emotion classification using pre-trained ML models
- 💡 Detection of six basic emotions: **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, **Fearful**, **Neutral**
- 🧠 Modular and extendable architecture for easy model or feature updates
- 🖼️ Works with static images, video files, and live streams

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `OpenCV` – real-time computer vision
  - `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` – deep learning frameworks (choose based on your model)
  - `Keras` – high-level neural networks API
  - `Dlib` / `Mediapipe` – facial landmarks (optional)
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – for visualization and performance analysis
- **Models**:
  - CNN or transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNetV2, VGGFace, FER2013 dataset)
